# Sync_Lib

**Sync_Lib** is a lightweight and efficient C++ library designed to streamline multithreaded applications. It provides two primary components:

- **Thread Pool**: A robust implementation for managing and reusing threads, optimizing performance for concurrent tasks.
- **Synchronized Logger**: A thread-safe logging utility to ensure consistent and conflict-free logging in multithreaded environments.

## Features

### Thread Pool
- Efficient thread reuse to minimize overhead.
- Dynamically adjusts to handle concurrent tasks.
- Simple and intuitive API for task management.

### Synchronized Logger
- Ensures thread-safe logging without race conditions.
- Supports logging to multiple outputs (e.g., files, console).
- Flexible configuration for custom logging formats.

## Why Use Sync_Lib?
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-performance, multithreaded applications.
- **Ease of Use**: Seamless integration with existing C++ projects.
- **Reliability**: Built with synchronization primitives to handle concurrency safely.
